Please answer the below core-java Questions:

Q. What is programing language?
A. A programming language is a computer language programmers use to develop software programs, scripts, or
other sets of instructions for computers to execute.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. What are the jdk components ? define each component?
A. The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development environment used to develop Java applications
and applets. It contains JRE and several development tools, an interpreter/loader (java), a compiler (javac),
an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (javadoc) accompanied with another tool.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. What is an IDE?
A. Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a software for building applications.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?
A. Eclipse, IntelliJ

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Explain the entire java life cycle.
A.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. What is class?
A. A class is a template used to create objects and to define object data types and methods.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. What is object?
A. An object is an instance or member of a Java class.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. What is the entry point of an application?
A.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Why main method is static?
A.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Which class is the superclass of all classes in java?
A.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. What is difference between path and classpath variables?
A.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
A. Interface is implicitly abstract and cannot be implemented. It can extend to another Interface only. Interface
   cannot be instantiated  i.e; cannot create an object of an interface. All the methods declared are abstract methods.

 Abstract class is a hybrid interface/class(half interface/half class) where we can have both abstract and non-abstract
 methods.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? how do you use interface and abstract class?
A. Interface cannot be instantiated. Whereas, Objects can be created in Abstract class as we can have non-abstract
methods.

Interface can be implemented using "implements" whereas abstract class can be inherited using "extends".

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. What is Access Specifier?
A. Access Specifiers AKA Access Modifiers are keywords that are defining the accessibility privileges of class and
properties/java elements.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
A. Object-Oriented Programming System (OOPs) is a programming concept that works on the principles of encapsulation,
inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

Encapsulation is data hiding. It involves a private variable. In order to use the variables we need to create a getter
and setter method. The setter is to set the value and the getter is to get/use the value.

Inheritance is about inheritance between classes. There are 3 types of inheritance: Single inheritance, Multi-Level
inheritance, and Hierarchical inheritance.

Polymorphism is about methods having multiple forms. There are 2 kinds of forms: overloading and overriding.
Overloading is about using the same method name with different number of parameters. Overriding is about using the same
method name, same parameter and a different body(implementation). It involves Inheritance and annotation "Override".

Abstraction is basically implementation hiding. It is a road-map.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
A. Java package is basically used for accessibility and grouping. By default, java imports the java.lang package.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
A. The term API is an acronym, and it stands for “Application Programming Interface.” An API is a set of
programming code that enables data transmission between one software product and another. It also contains
the terms of this data exchange.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Does java support multiple inheritance?
A. No. Java does not support multiple inheritance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. What is method overloading and when it happens?
A. Overloading is about using the same method name with different number of parameters.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it?
A.  An exception is an event, which occurs during the execution of a program, that disrupts the normal flow
of the program's instructions. When an error occurs within a method, the method creates an object and
hands it off to the runtime system. The try-catch is the simplest method of handling exceptions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables, methods and classes?
A. The keyword static means that the particular member belongs to a type itself, rather than to an instance
of that type. This means we'll create only one instance of that static member that is shared across all
instances of the class.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. What is final and how it has been used variables, methods and classes?
A. Final is a keyword which has power over variable and makes it non-replaceable, has power over methods and
makes it non overridable and power over class that makes it non-inheritable.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. What is final, finally and finalize?
A. Final is a keyword which has power over variable and makes it non-replaceable, has power over methods and makes it
non overridable and power over class that makes it non-inheritable.

Finally is a keyword and is used as access modifier in Java. Finally is a block in Java used for Exception handling.

Finalize is a method used for Garbage collection.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. What is a constructor ?
A. A constructor is a special method of a class or structure in object-oriented programming that initializes
a newly created object of that type. Whenever an object is created, the constructor is called automatically.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
A. Yes. As long as the Constructors carry different parameters, a class can have multiple constructors.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
A.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. What is "this" keyword in java ?
A.The "this" keyword refers to the current object in a method or constructor. The most common use of
the this keyword is to eliminate the confusion between class attributes and parameters with the same name.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. What is "super" keyword in java? How to use it?
A. The super keyword refers to superclass (parent) objects. It is used to call superclass methods, and to
access the superclass constructor. The most common use of the super keyword is to eliminate the confusion
between superclasses and subclasses that have methods with the same name.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. What is JVM stand for?
A. Java Virtual Machine, or JVM, loads, verifies and executes Java bytecode. It is known as the interpreter
or the core of Java programming language because it executes Java programming.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Is JVM platform independent?
A. The JVM is not platform independent. Java Virtual Machine (JVM) provides the environment to execute the
java file(. Class file). So at the end it's depends on your kernel , and kernel is differ from OS
(Operating System) to OS.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. What version of java are you using?
A. JDK 11

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. What is JAR stand for?
A. JAR stands for Java Archives.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. What is the difference between JDK and JVM?
A. Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development environment used for developing Java applications
and applets. It includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), an interpreter/loader (Java), a compiler
(javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (Javadoc), and other tools needed in Java development.

JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is a very important part of both JDK and JRE because it is contained or inbuilt
in both. It is an environment for executing bytecodes. Whatever Java program you run using JRE or JDK goes
into JVM and JVM is responsible for executing the java program line by line, hence it is also known as an
interpreter.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
A. JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is a very important part of both JDK and JRE because it is contained or inbuilt
in both. It is an environment for executing bytecodes. Whatever Java program you run using JRE or JDK goes
into JVM and JVM is responsible for executing the java program line by line, hence it is also known as an
interpreter.

JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is an installation package that provides an environment to only
run(not develop) the java program(or application)onto your machine. JRE is only used by those who only
want to run Java programs that are end-users of your system.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. What is compile time and run time?
A. Compile-Time Errors: Errors that occur when you violate the rules of writing syntax are known as
   Compile-Time errors.
   Run-Time Errors: Errors which occur during program execution(run-time) after successful compilation are
   called run-time errors.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
A. Strings in Java are the objects that are backed internally by a char array. Strings are immutable
   StringBuffer is a peer class of String that provides much of the functionality of strings. The string
   represents fixed-length, immutable character sequences while StringBuffer represents growable and
   writable character sequences.
   StringBuilder in Java represents a mutable sequence of characters. Since the String Class in Java creates
   an immutable sequence of characters, the StringBuilder class provides an alternative to String Class,
   as it creates a mutable sequence of characters.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. What is Singleton class?
A. In object-oriented programming, a singleton class is a class that can have only one object (an instance
of the class) at a time. After the first time, if we try to instantiate the Singleton class, the new variable
also points to the first instance created. So whatever modifications we do to any variable inside the class
through any instance, affects the variable of the single instance created and is visible if we access that
variable through any variable of that class type defined.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. What is the difference between while and do..while loop?
A. A while loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given
Boolean condition. The while loop can be thought of as a repeating if statement.
do while loop is similar to while loop with the only difference that it checks for the condition after
executing the statements.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. What is Enum?
A. Enum/Enumerations serve the purpose of representing a group of named constants in a programming language.
Enum declaration can be done outside a Class or inside a Class but not inside a Method.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. What is Iterator?
A. A Java Cursor is an Iterator, which is used to iterate or traverse or retrieve a Collection or
Stream object’s elements one by one.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?
A. Integer will take more memory because int is a primitive data type and Integer is a wrapper class.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. What does JIT stands for?
A. The Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler is a an essential part of the JRE i.e. Java Runtime Environment, that is
responsible for performance optimization of java based applications at run time. Compiler is one of the key
aspects in deciding performance of an application for both parties i.e. the end user and the application
developer.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. What is Recursion?
A. The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the
corresponding function is called as recursive function.
